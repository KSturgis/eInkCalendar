NOTE - This project is not yet ready for Prime Time. The author is working on Rev 1.4 which is
a completly new hardware that uses and ESP32-C3 directly rather than a T-Micro32 board carrying
an ESP32. Rev 1.4 also puts a AAA battery holder directly on the board. 

# Version 1.3
First version that is publically released. This version was tested with a small run of ~20 units.
This is still a beta release. There is an issue where the SD card continually drains the battery
and will cause the batteries to drain in ~3 months when using AAA batteries.

# Versions prior to 1.3
These haven't been released publically and are only incrementally different from 1.3.
